##Introduction
This project aims to provide an efficient and accurate face mask detection system. With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring the proper use of face masks has become crucial. This application can be used in various environments such as offices, shopping malls, and public transport to monitor and ensure compliance with mask-wearing guidelines.

##Features
Real-time face mask detection
High accuracy with TensorFlow deep learning model
User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
Easy to deploy and use
##Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/basantadharala/face_mask_detection.git
cd face_mask_detection
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
##Usage
To use the face mask detection web application, follow these steps:

Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open your web browser and go to:


##Model Training
To train the face mask detection model, follow these steps:

##Prepare your dataset:

Collect images of people with and without face masks.
Organize the dataset into two folders: with_mask and without_mask.
Train the model:

##Web Application
The web application is built using Streamlit, a fast and user-friendly way to create web apps in Python.

Upload an image: Users can upload an image, and the app will detect and classify faces as wearing a mask or not.
Real-time detection: Using the webcam, the app can detect faces and classify them in real-time.
